# Advent-of-Code
My solutions for the website "Advent of Code".

The python scripts are my initial solutions. I then (very roughly) translated them into C. I prioritized solving them as fast as possible so they are probably not the most efficient/readable.

The files named "test.txt" contain the simple inputs given to test the programs. The files "input.txt" contain the input given to get the correct answers.

Run "make" to compile both c files.
Run "make part_x" to only compile the program for the corresponding part x.
Run "make clean" to remove the compiled binary.

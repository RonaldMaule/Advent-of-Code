# Advent-of-Code
My solutions for the website "Advent of Code".

The python scripts are my initial solutions. I then (very roughly) translated them into C. I prioritized solving them as fast as possible to they are probably not the most efficient/readable.

The files named "test.txt" contain the simple inputs given to test the programs. The files "input.txt" contain the input given to get the correct answers.
